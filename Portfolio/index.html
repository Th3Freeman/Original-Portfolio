            Hello, my name is Nick, I am currently a student taking a full stack web development course. This is my first real web page built from scratch. I know it looks a bit rough right now, but eventually I should be able to make a more polished product with some real utility build in.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Fun facts: 
            Before I started this course I was the DM for a weekly DND game that I hosted for some friends of mine.

            I am a certified scuba diver.

            And I am surprisingly skilled with nunchuks.
        </p>

        <p>
            My aspirations here are to hopefully build a fulfilling freelance career and travel the world while working on projects that I choose for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            A man can dream right?
